🚦 Smart Traffic Issue Reporter – Project Overview Script
Hello, my name is [Your Name], and I'd like to briefly walk you through a project I built called COPS: Smart Traffic Issue Reporter. It's a real-time, map-based web application designed to improve urban mobility and safety by allowing users to report and visualize traffic-related problems like accidents, traffic jams, and roadblocks.

💡 Problem Solved
In most cities, traffic management systems lack real-time public input, making it difficult for authorities and drivers to respond to sudden disruptions. My system bridges this gap by crowdsourcing live traffic issue reports and displaying them on an interactive map, empowering both citizens and traffic departments.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Leaflet.js for interactive maps and OpenRouteService for live route planning.

Backend: Flask (Python) API to handle data submission and retrieval.

Storage: JSON file-based storage for simplicity (can be upgraded to a database).

APIs Used:

TomTom for map and traffic layers

OpenRouteService for navigation and routing

⚙️ Key Features
📍 Real-Time Issue Reporting:
Users can report traffic issues using geolocation or by clicking on the map. Each report includes a description, type (e.g., accident, roadblock), and timestamp.

🗺️ Interactive Map with Live Traffic:
All reports appear on the map instantly, with icons and color-coded popups. The map includes live traffic overlays from TomTom.

🧭 Navigation with Route Planning:
Users can choose start and end points to see optimal driving routes while avoiding reported trouble spots.

🧠 Smart Categorization:
Descriptions are automatically categorized into issue types using keyword matching (e.g., “crash” becomes “Accident”).

🔄 Auto-Refresh and Filtering:
The map refreshes every few seconds to display the latest reports. Users can also filter reports by issue type.

🎯 Impact & Future Scope
This project simulates a scalable system that can help smart cities crowdsource traffic data, improving response times and route efficiency. It can be enhanced with:

User authentication

Integration with city transport APIs

Database support (e.g., MySQL or MongoDB)

Real-time notifications

This project highlights my full-stack development skills, real-world problem-solving, and integration of geospatial technologies. I'd be excited to further scale this system in a real-world deployment or contribute similar innovations to your company..
